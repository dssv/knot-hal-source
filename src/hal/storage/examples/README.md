## How to test EEPROOM functions from KNoT ##

To test the examples that access the EEPROM with KNoT functions it is necessary
to follow some simple steps.

1 - You must first generate a .zip file from the KNoT_EEPROM_Test folder.
```
zip -r KNoT_EEPROM_Test.zip KNoT_EEPROM_Test
```

2 - You must open the Arduino IDE and add the generated library manually.

3 - You can now go directly to the Arduino IDE panel and access the read and
write samples in the EEPROM.
